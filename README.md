## :dizzy: Improvements and notes

- I tried to my best in just a couple of hours so the website is not complete, It needs to be completed.
- I focused myself on the scaffolding of the project and internal logics to have a scalable application that can be a good start to improve on.
- The UI could be better and more similar to the Figma file.
