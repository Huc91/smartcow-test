# :notes: Who sings

Musixmatch Front-end test

## :rocket: Goals and purpose

Goal of the game:
choose the artist that sings a specific line of lyrics, winning points for every correct choice
Must have features:

- quiz card with one line of lyrics and 3 artists to choose from
- the game ends after completing N quiz cards, one after the other
- ask the name of the player with the ability to log off so that another user could play
- count the points and save them at the end of the game
- the screens of the game should be:
- the quiz screen
- the user's screen where they can see their name and the points of the last N games
- the high score screen where you can see a chart of the best players

## :pencil2: UI

I designed the UI for this app on Figma.

## :computer: Commands

### `yarn start`

## :dizzy: Improvements

- I could add more genres, only rap for now.
- Better handling of lyrics quotes

## :scream: Known issues

- The CORS proxy is deployed as an app on my free tier on Heroku. It takes a bit to "warm up" so the first API call takes a little bit more time.
- I should avoid one event listener for each button and use event bubbling to have just one listener.
